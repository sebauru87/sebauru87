### Hi there 👋 I'm a versatile and results driven Full Stack developer and airline pilot.

Programming and flying have always been my two passions. Although I have been programming as a hobby since I was 12, after graduating from high school I decided to become an airline pilot. This choice made me spend 15 years in the airline industry, working and living in places such as Dubai, England and Panama.

In 2020 I decided to change my career path and return to programming. I enrolled myself and completed a full-time Coding Bootcamp, where I invested over 650 hours learning about React.js, Node.js and databases.

I'm highly motivated to learn new software technologies and I consider myself a natural problem-solver.

I'm currently working as a Full Stack developer, where I can both utilize my engineering skills and bring my knowledge and expertise gained through my aviation experience.

Technologies: 
JavaScript (ES6+), React.js, Next.js, Node.js, Express, Unit Testing, MySQL, MongoDB, Firebase, HTML, CSS

Skills:
Teamwork, Leadership, Communication, Crew Resource management, Multi-cultural experience, Decision making
